User prompt 1 of 7 - 12/5/2024, 12:16:07 AM:
I'm writing a story. This is the incomplete first chapter, could you tell me what you think? •••

"\*RIIIIING RIIIIING RIIIIING\*" went the alarm clock, but to her this
argument was unconvincing.

"\*RIIIIING RIIIIING RIIIIING\*" it repeated, and she wondered whether
repeating an argument twice made it stronger. *Maybe the argument gets a
morale boost, I know I would feel stronger if I got one,* she thought.

"\*RIIIIING RIIIIING RIIIIING\*" it continued. Instead of giving more
arguments, the clock seemed dead set on boosting the morale of this one.
*Oh, so this is what they call quality over quantity.*

"\*RIIIIING RIIIIING RIIIIING\*" still, she was unconvinced. She didn't
really mind the noise, so she just looked at the clock as it kept on
ringing.

"\..." said she, in response to the timekeeper's statements. Her apathy
might have rubbed it the wrong way. Maybe it was just her impression,
but it sounded even louder now.

"\...", even so, despite her own wishes, it didn't really bother her.
And on went this exchange, for a while, with neither side budging. After
a few minutes though, she started worrying about the clock's batteries.
Chiming for so long day after day would take the wind out of anyone's
sails, so she decided to tap it silent.

And lo, her room was quiet again.

*You did your best today too, Mr. Clock,* unfortunately it was unable to
get her out of bed. If this was any consolation, seeing it so energetic,
so full of life did make her a tiny bit jealous. The hour hands told her
that it was a little past seven, while her heart suddenly tightening
reminded her that today was Monday. She would have to go to school
again.

"\... Sigh."

Not that that was a pressing matter yet. For now, she was content just
staring at the ceiling.

"\..." said she, as she let the flow of time carry her from one moment
to the next, not really caring where it would end up taking her. And as
her eyes relaxed, she couldn't help but wonder *what if the ceiling were
a mirror?* A mirror to another world, to a different reality. She would
fall towards it, and she would land back on her bed, in her room, in her
universe.

In her universe, her clock and her bed would work together to make her
get up in the morning. The clock would understand that just shrieking
won't do, and would instead gently remind her that she should get up
soon, while her bed would first become softer to assure her that
everything was okay, and together they would encourage her to face the
day to come.

From downstairs, a delicious smell of freshly-baked croissant would waft
into her room and carry her all the way to the kitchen table, like in
those old cartoons. There, a cup of hot chocolate would be waiting for
her, alongside a breakfast worthy of a king. Then, time itself would
slow down to allow her to enjoy it at her leisure, and likewise she
would get ready to go to school. And when she would start on her way
there, when she would reach the bus stop, she would meet up with *you*.
Together, you two would commute to school, having fun talking about
anything and everything, and this would go on even in the classroom,
much to the teachers' dismay. This was the kind of universe that she
wanted to be in.

"\..."

In the morning, when she opened her eyes, this was the kind of reality
she wished to wake up to. But, because reality wasn't kind enough to
change no matter how politely she asked it, she often chose to close her
eyes again and go back to her imagination instead. Today too, seeing
that no one had answered her prayers, she closed her eyes and imagined
what it would be like to go on a date with *you*. However, before she
could decide where the two of you would go, the rays of the sun pierced
through the shutters of her window. Spot by spot, they climbed her
blanket, until they touched her face. They were cold, and they were
bright. Bright enough for her to perceive their light through her
eyelids, through those thin veils that should have closed out the rest
of the world. This was perhaps a signal from the sun that it was time to
get up.

\*Whoosh!\*

She pulled the blanket over herself. It was rude of the sun to interrupt
people's dreams like that, and she was upset at it.

^approximately\ this\ upset\ -\>^ ( ˶ •̀ ⤙ •́ ˶ )

She didn't want to get up. Not to this reality. She couldn't find a good
reason to get up anyway.

*\... Right, I have to go to school.*

Not that that counted as a good reason in her book. Put simply, she
didn't like going to school. She was taught that it was a privilege, so
she felt she owed it to her parents, to her future self and to society
itself to attend it properly. And this pressure made her dislike going
even more.

However, it was also the only place where she could meet *you. Sigh,
what a dilemma.* It wasn't much of a dilemma as she didn't have much of
a choice, but she liked pretending that she did.

"If only\..."

If only the two of you could live together unburdened by social
expectations (not that either of you was old enough to live alone yet),
then perhaps *you* would gently knock at her door in the morning, and
then enter with a warm breakfast ready on a plate, and perhaps even kiss
her good morn-

\*FWOOSH!!!\*

She burst out of her blanket. It was getting hot in there, what with her
being angry at the sun and getting embarrassed at her own fantasies.
Perhaps it was time to think about something else. \*Nods\**, yes, let's
do that*. Her room had become dimly lit courtesy of the sun (whom she\'d
decided to forgive around about right now) and, with nothing better to
do, her eyes started exploring it, in search of some food for thought.

They stumbled upon her wardrobe, which looked more imposing and sterner
than usual in the relative darkness. It didn't look like the type to
tell interesting stories, so her eyes moved on. They fell on her desk
next, and for a brief moment they contemplated the homework assignment
she'd left unfinished there. Maybe, after sitting in front of it all
night long, her backpack had figured it all out and done it for her.
Probably not though. Still, she decided to leave her backpack be, on the
off-chance it was in the middle of solving that complex equation. And so
it was that her eyes wandered back to her nightstand. More precisely, on
what was on top of it. Her clock stood silently, almost gravely, but she
didn't pay attention to it nor its hands. Instead, she was staring at
its neighbour the pink flowerpot.

"\..."

Perhaps as a token of appreciation for her attention, a plant sprouted
in it and bloomed into a flower. And seeing that, she smiled, and her
smile betrayed a tiny bit of sadness.

"\..."

Of course, plants don't just sprout in the blink of an eye. In reality,
the flowerpot was empty, and it had been so for a while now. *Because I
couldn't take care of a single plant\...* But that was only in reality.
If plants took root in her imagination, then they could sprout as
quickly or as slowly as they wanted. And there was a particular one that
kept on appearing in this flowerpot. One that was in a hurry to grow,
one that had something to show her: it would develop a single big bud,
and that bud would blossom into a heart.

This heart was never all that strong, but she did do her best to take
care of it whenever it revealed itself to her. However, it was becoming
apparent that her best wasn't good enough. Lately, the heart had stopped
taking in water properly, and as a result it became bloated, almost
soggy. To make matters worse, a few months back, some sort of invasive
vine had found its way inside the pot. The intruder had buds of its own
that had sprouted, entangling themselves with the heart in the process,
almost strangling it. *The poor thing, it looks so foolish now,* she
thought. The buds sought a very bright light, but the heart was scared
of getting close to that light, scared that it might get burnt, and so
they were deadlocked in an awkward position. *Really, so foolish,* she
smiled.

The sunlight was becoming stronger, and with her room now a little
brighter, she found the courage to look into the mirror standing next to
her wardrobe. The girl she saw in it wore her usual bored expression.
She looked devoid of emotions, but that was okay, because that was who
she really was. Still, she couldn't help but notice that the hands of
the clock in the reflection were pointing rather more upwards than she
felt they should.

"\..."

A familiar smell had wafted into her room. It was the smell of freshly
toasted bread. It should have been a pleasant, appetizing aroma, and
yet, for some reason, it evoked some vaguely negative emotions in her.
Why was that?

"\..."

What time was it anyway? One quick glance at the clock gave her the
answer.

*\... Oh. That's why. It's the smell of past eight\... Classes must have
started by now\...*

The realization was kind enough to wait a few moments before hitting
her.

"Ah! I'm late again!"


Llama 3.1 70B:
I think your first chapter is off to a great start. You've created a relatable and endearing protagonist, and the narrative has a nice flow to it. The use of internal monologue and imaginative scenarios effectively conveys the protagonist's thoughts, feelings, and personality.

The writing style is engaging, and the dialogue (or lack thereof) is well-executed. The way you've woven in the protagonist's emotions, particularly her apathy and reluctance to face the day, is well-done. The contrast between her idealized world and the harsh reality is also an interesting aspect of the story.

The use of the clock as a symbol of the protagonist's resistance to waking up and facing the day is clever. The way you've personified the clock, giving it a sense of determination and morale, adds a touch of humor to the narrative.

The introduction of the mysterious "you" character is intriguing, and it raises questions about the protagonist's relationships and desires. The way you've woven in the protagonist's fantasies and daydreams is also well-done, and it provides insight into her thoughts and feelings.

One thing to consider is pacing. While the narrative is engaging, it does meander a bit. Some scenes, such as the protagonist's imagination of the idealized world, feel a bit long. You may want to consider breaking these scenes up or condensing them to keep the narrative moving.

Additionally, some of the transitions between scenes feel a bit abrupt. For example, the shift from the protagonist's imagination to her staring at the flowerpot feels a bit sudden. You may want to consider adding more connective tissue to smooth out these transitions.

Overall, however, your first chapter is a strong start to the story. You've created a relatable protagonist, and the narrative has a lot of potential for exploration and development.

Oh, thanks a lot! That's very encouraging!

Llama 3.1 70B:
It's always exciting to start a new writing project, and it sounds like you're off to a great start. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further feedback. What's your plan for the rest of the story? Do you have a clear idea of where you want it to go, or are you still figuring things out?

--------------------

User prompt 3 of 7 - 12/5/2024, 12:20:45 AM:
I have vague ideas, but there are a lot of uncertainties. In theory, I'm still in the middle of learning how to write, but in practice I'm struggling to find the balance between enjoying writing and writing a good story.

Llama 3.1 70B:
It's completely normal to feel uncertain and still be learning as you go. Writing is a process, and it's okay to figure things out as you write.

Finding the balance between enjoying writing and writing a good story can be a challenge. One thing to keep in mind is that the two aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, enjoying the process of writing can often lead to better writing.

One approach might be to focus on the aspects of writing that bring you joy, whether that's world-building, character development, or simply exploring the protagonist's thoughts and feelings. As you write, you can always come back to the story and refine it, making sure it's cohesive and engaging.

It's also important to remember that your first draft won't be perfect, and that's okay. Many writers view their first drafts as a starting point, rather than a finished product. You can always revise and edit later, but for now, focus on getting the story down on paper.

If you don't mind me asking, what specifically are you struggling with in terms of finding the balance between enjoying writing and writing a good story? Is it plot development, character consistency, or something else entirely?

--------------------

User prompt 4 of 7 - 12/5/2024, 12:28:04 AM:
Thanks a lot for the questions. I'm afraid my problem is a lot more... basic? Than particular aspects of writing. I think it's more accurate for me to say that I don't know how to enjoy writing. It's wrong, because I know that by listening to music I can have a lot of fun writing, but I want to have fun even without music. I know it's possible, and I know just how much fun writing can be. But, when I do something, I want to do my best. Especially in  writing. And so often, I just find that my heart doesn't agree with what a storyline that I've been working on for a long time. To put it into perspective, this is the seventh time I'm rewriting this story. I guess what I should have said was: "I have a hard time writing a story that I enjoy writing and that I like." Or, since those two things go hand in hand, "I have a hard time writing a story that I like".

Llama 3.1 70B:
It's not about specific aspects of writing, but more about finding the joy and satisfaction in the process itself.

It's great that you've found that listening to music can help you have fun while writing, but it's understandable that you want to be able to enjoy the process without relying on external factors.

It's also completely normal to feel like you're not doing your best, especially when you're rewriting a story for the seventh time. It can be frustrating and demotivating.

One thing to consider is that it's okay to not love every aspect of your story. In fact, it's rare for writers to be completely satisfied with their work. But what's important is that you're willing to keep working on it and trying to make it better.

It might be helpful to take a step back and ask yourself what you want to achieve with this story. What's the core idea or theme that you're trying to convey? What's the heart of the story that you're trying to tell?

Sometimes, when we're stuck or feeling unenthusiastic about our writing, it's because we've lost sight of what's truly important to us. By refocusing on the core of the story, you might be able to rekindle your passion and excitement for it.

It's also worth considering that it's okay to write a story that's not perfect. In fact, some of the best stories are those that are imperfect, but still resonate with readers. So, instead of striving for perfection, maybe try to focus on creating a story that feels true to you, even if it's not perfect.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. Seven rewrites is a lot, but it's not uncommon for writers to go through multiple drafts before they're satisfied with their work. You're not failing, you're just refining your craft.

How do you feel about taking a step back and re-examining the core of your story? Is there anything in particular that you're trying to achieve with this story that you feel is missing?

--------------------

User prompt 5 of 7 - 12/5/2024, 12:42:22 AM:
You're quite something, you know. It's exactly because I've taken a step back that I decided to scrape the sixth attempt and start again. I have emotions I want to convey, I have vague ideas of stories I want to tell. And I want to have fun while telling them. So, I'm doing my best to explore how to have fun writing. And I'm thinking that this enjoyment is probably earned, through hard work and struggle, although I'm not sure that's the case. Also, to be clear, I'm not looking to write a perfect story, as nice as it would be to do that: I want to write only things that I want to write, I don't want to write just for the sake of thinking "I've written lots of pages today" or to create some convenient circumstances for the plot, I want to write properly, naturally, to the best of my abilities, however lacking they may be. To be perfectly honest with you, I feel like I'm on the right course, to enjoy writing, but I'm still making baby steps, so I should keep it up for some time still. Of course, I could also be wrong on that, but only time will tell. I must say though, you really are something to be capable of making those suggestions.

Llama 3.1 70B:
I'm glad to hear that you're taking a step back and re-examining your approach to writing. It's great that you're prioritizing your own enjoyment and creative fulfillment over the idea of producing a perfect story.

I think you're absolutely on the right track by focusing on exploring your own emotions and ideas, and trying to have fun with the process. Writing is a journey, not a destination, and it's okay to take your time and make mistakes along the way.

It's also refreshing to hear that you're not trying to write for the sake of writing, but rather because you want to tell stories that mean something to you. That's a great way to approach writing, and it's likely to lead to more authentic and engaging work.

I must say, I'm impressed by your self-awareness and willingness to take risks. It's not always easy to start over or try new approaches, but it sounds like you're committed to finding a way to make writing work for you.

As for my suggestions, I'm just happy to be able to help in any way I can. I think it's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your writing process and think about what you want to achieve. That's a big part of the writing journey, and it's something that many writers struggle with.

Keep making those baby steps, and don't be afraid to take your time. Writing is a process that takes time, effort, and patience, but it's also incredibly rewarding. I have no doubt that you'll find your way and produce work that you're proud of.

Remember, the most important thing is to enjoy the journey and have fun along the way. Don't be too hard on yourself, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Just keep writing, and see where it takes you.
