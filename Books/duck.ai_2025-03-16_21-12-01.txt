What does this onomatopoeia make you think of: "Haah...."?

Llama 3.3 70B:
The onomatopoeia "Haah...." makes me think of a sigh or a deep breath, often expressing relief, exhaustion, or a sense of accomplishment. It's a sound that people might make after finishing a challenging task, hearing good news, or letting out a deep breath after holding it in for a while.

User prompt 2 of 6 - 3/16/2025, 7:53:41 PM:
Wonderful, I'm glad you didn't even need context to understand what I wanted to convey. Thanks a lot.

Llama 3.3 70B:
Onomatopoeias can be very evocative and convey a lot of meaning, even without context. I'm glad I could understand what you were getting at with "Haah...." and provide a relevant response. If you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask.

Could I ask for your feedback on a story I'm writing? More specifically, I want feedback on the last section. But, because of limitations, I'll have to give you the first two sections or chapters separately (i.e. in two messages). The last section will be the third message from this. Oh, and the original files are in .odt, so conversion to .md might have caused formatting issues. Here's the first section:
`•

"\*RIIIIING RIIIIING RIIIIING\*" went the alarm clock, but to her this
argument was unconvincing.

"\*RIIIIING RIIIIING RIIIIING\*" it repeated, and she wondered whether
repeating an argument twice made it stronger. *Maybe the argument gets a
morale boost, I know I would feel stronger if I got one, *she thought.

"\*RIIIIING RIIIIING RIIIIING\*" it continued. Instead of giving more
arguments, the clock seemed dead set on boosting the morale of this one.
*Oh, so this is what they call quality over quantity.*

Even so, despite her own wishes, the noise didn't really bother her.

"\...", she replied to every ring. And on went this exchange, for a
while, with neither side budging. After a few minutes though, she
started worrying about the clock's batteries. Chiming for so long day
after day would take the wind out of anyone's sails, so she decided to
tap it silent.

And lo, her room was quiet again.

*You did your best today too, Mr. Clock, *unfortunately it was unable to
get her out of bed. If this was any consolation, seeing it so energetic,
so full of life did make her a tiny bit jealous.

The hour hands told her that it was a little past seven, while her
suddenly tightening heart reminded her that today was Monday. She would
have to go to school again.

"\... Sigh."

Not that that was a pressing matter yet. For now, she was content just
staring at the ceiling. She let the flow of time carry her from one
moment to the next, not really caring where it would end up taking her.
And as her eyes relaxed, she couldn't help but wonder *what if the
ceiling were a mirror? *A mirror to another world, to a different
reality. She would fall towards it, and she would land back on her bed,
in her room, in her world.

In her world, clocks would wake people up with a gentle, crescendo
melody. Hers would come into her dreams and accompany her back into
reality, all the while listening to her talk of her adventures.

And when she does get up, from downstairs, a delicious smell of
freshly-baked croissant would waft into her room and carry her all the
way to the kitchen table, like in those old cartoons. There, a cup of
hot chocolate would be waiting for her, alongside a breakfast worthy of
a queen. Then, time itself would slow down to allow her to enjoy it at
her leisure, and likewise she would get ready to go to school. And when
she would start on her way there, when she would reach the bus stop, she
would meet up with *you*. Together, you two would commute to school
while talking about anything and everything, and this would go on even
in the classroom, much to the teachers' dismay. This was the kind of
universe that she wanted to be in.

"\..."

In the morning, when she opened her eyes, this was the kind of reality
she wished to wake up to. But, because reality wasn't kind enough to
change no matter how politely she asked it, she often chose to close her
eyes again and go back to her imagination instead. Today too, seeing
that no one had answered her prayers, she closed her eyes and imagined
what it would be like to go on a date with *you*. However, before she
could decide where the two of you would go, the rays of the sun pierced
through the shutters of her window. Spot by spot, they climbed her
blanket, until they touched her face. They were cold, and they were
bright. Bright enough for her to perceive their light through her
eyelids, through those thin veils that should have closed out the rest
of the world. This was perhaps a signal from the sun that it was time to
get up.

\*Whoosh!\*

She pulled the blanket over herself. It was rude of the sun to interrupt
people's dreams like that, and she was upset at it.

^approximately\ this\ upset\ -\>\ ^( ˶ •̀ ⤙ •́ ˶ )

She didn't want to get up. Not to this reality. There weren't good
reasons to get up in it.

*\... Right, I have to go to school.*

Not that that counted as a good reason. She didn't like going to school.
She'd been taught that it was a privilege, so she felt she owed it to
her parents, to her future self and to society itself to attend it
properly; and this pressure made her dislike going even more.

However, it was also the only place where she could meet *you. Sigh,
what a dilemma. *It wasn't much of a dilemma as she didn't have much of
a choice, but she liked pretending that she did.

"If only\..."

If only the two of you could live together unburdened by social
expectations (not that either of you was old enough to live alone yet),
then perhaps *you* would gently knock at her door in the morning, and
then enter with a warm breakfast ready on a plate, and perhaps even kiss
her good morn-

\*FWOOSH!!!\*

She burst out of her blanket. It was getting hot in there, what with her
being angry at the sun and getting embarrassed at her own fantasies.
Perhaps it was time to think about something else. \*Nods\**, yes, let's
do that*. Her room had become dimly lit courtesy of the sun (whom she\'d
decided to forgive around about right now) and, with nothing better to
do, her eyes started exploring it, in search of some food for thought.

They stumbled upon her wardrobe, which looked bigger and sterner than
usual in the relative darkness. It didn't seem like the type to share
interesting stories, so her eyes moved on. They fell on her desk next,
and for a brief moment they contemplated the homework assignment she'd
left unfinished there. Maybe, after sitting in front of it all night
long, her backpack had done it for her. An essay, was it? Yes, probably.
Her eyes wandered back to her nightstand. More precisely, on what was on
top of it. Her clock stood silently, almost gravely, but she didn't pay
attention to it nor its hands. Instead, she was staring at its neighbour
the pink flowerpot:

"\..."

Perhaps as a token of appreciation for her attention, a plant sprouted
in it and bloomed into a flower. And seeing that made her smile, and her
smile betrayed a tiny bit of sadness.

Of course, plants don't just sprout in the blink of an eye. In reality,
the flowerpot was empty, and it had been so for a while now. *Because I
couldn't take care of a single plant\... *Thankfully, that was only in
reality. If plants took root in her imagination, then they could sprout
as quickly or as slowly as they wanted. And there was a particular one
that kept on appearing in this flowerpot. One that was in a hurry to
grow, one that had something to show her: it would develop a single big
bud, and that bud would blossom into a heart.

This heart was never all that strong, but she did do her best to take
care of it whenever it revealed itself to her. However, it was becoming
apparent that her best wasn't good enough. Lately, the heart had stopped
taking in water properly, and as a result it became bloated, almost
soggy. To make matters worse, a few months back, some sort of invasive
vine had found its way inside the pot. The intruder had buds of its own
that had sprouted, entangling themselves with the heart in the process,
almost strangling it. *The poor thing, it looks so foolish now,* she
thought. The buds sought a particularly bright light, but the heart was
scared of getting close to that light, scared that it might get burnt,
and so they were deadlocked in an awkward position. *Really, so foolish,
*she smiled.

The sunlight was becoming stronger, and her room was now a little
brighter. This gave her the courage to look into the mirror standing
next to her wardrobe. The girl she saw in it wore her usual bored
expression. She looked devoid of emotions, but that was okay, because
that was who she really was. Still, she couldn't help but notice that
the hands of the clock in the reflection were pointing rather more
upwards than she felt they should.

"\..."

A familiar smell wafted into her room. It was the smell of freshly
toasted bread. It should have been a pleasant, appetizing aroma, and
yet, for some reason, it evoked some vaguely negative emotions in her.
Why was that?

"\..."

What time was it anyway? A quick glance at the clock gave her the
answer.

*\... Oh. That's why. It's the smell of past eight\... Classes should
start anytime now\...*

The realisation was kind enough to wait a few moments before hitting
her.

"Ah! I'm late!"

Her first instinct was to rush out of bed, but one foot got caught in
the sheets and

\*Thud\*

She fell to the floor. And yet, without a word, she got up and ran to
her wardrobe. There was no time to complain. Literally. She got changed
as fast as she could. That done, she dashed to the bathroom, washed her
face, and spent a moment to fix her bed hair in the mirror, all the
while avoiding the guilty eyes reflected in it. Then, in one breath, she
exited the bathroom, kidnapped the backpack from its chair and flung
open the door to her room. The next moment, she was flying down the
stairs, straight into the kitchen. She let out a

"Hi Mom!", stole a slice of bread from the table, followed with a

"Bye Mom!", and was out of the front door.

She kept up this pace now that she was outside, barely giving herself
time to put on her backpack and munch on the bread. It had become her
routine, to jog like this every school day, but despite her consistency
her heart seemed unable to get used to it. Her heart was weak, and it
didn't show signs of growing any stronger. *My heart is weak. *She knew
that, she was painfully aware of that, and yet, even so\...

She made a promise to herself: she'd decided that this week would be the
week. She hadn't settled on a specific day yet, but, she had something
she wanted to do.

*I have something I want to tell you.*

For how weak it was, for how scared it was to get burnt, this heart had
resolved itself to seek its light. One way or another, it would put an
end to this mess. *One way or another.*

Because of that, today she ran a little faster than usual, and for a
little longer. Still, old habits die hard, and this morning too she
would fail to catch the bus she was hoping to ride; she rounded the
corner just in time to see it at the stop, closing its doors in
preparation to leave.

"Wait!!" she called out, but buses don't have ears.

This morning too, it departed without her. This morning too, she would
be terribly late for school.

Llama 3.3 70B:
I've read the first section of your story. It's a thoughtful and imaginative piece that explores the protagonist's inner world and her struggles with reality. The use of fantasy and daydreaming as a coping mechanism is well-portrayed, and the writing is engaging and descriptive.

I particularly enjoyed the way you wove together the protagonist's thoughts, feelings, and observations to create a rich and immersive narrative. The imagery is vivid, and the dialogue (even when it's just the protagonist talking to herself) is natural and believable.

The story also raises some interesting themes, such as the tension between the protagonist's desire for a more idealized reality and the harshness of her actual life. The character's struggles with motivation, self-doubt, and anxiety are relatable and well-depicted.

One thing that stood out to me was the use of the flowerpot and the heart as a symbol of the protagonist's emotional state. It's a powerful and evocative metaphor that adds depth to the story.

I'm looking forward to reading the next section and seeing how the story develops. Please go ahead and share the second section, and I'll be happy to provide further feedback.

--------------------

User prompt 4 of 6 - 3/16/2025, 8:35:28 PM:
Thanks a lot. This is the second section:
`••

Do mirrors ever lie? That's what she was wondering while looking at one,
in the restroom.

"Do you?" she asked it. *Do you ever try to pass someone else as me, or,
*more importantly, *do you ever pretend that I haven't changed when I
have?*

It didn't answer.

"Hm\..."

*How suspicious\...* Did it perhaps have something to hide?

"Do you ever lie?" she asked again, eyeing it distrustfully.

^something\ like\ this\ -\>^ (≖\`‸´≖)

She checked her reflection against her memories and the image she had of
herself. The short hair, the tired eyes, the nearly-expressionless face,
they all matched. Why did they match? They shouldn't match. This made
her more suspicious than ever. She tried looking from different angles,
closing then opening her eyes, holding her hair in a ponytail, and
finally sticking her tongue out to taunt the mirror, but the girl it
reflected was always unmistakably herself.

*Alright then\...*

"I'm keeping an eye on you," she said, gesturing to it with her fingers
to make herself extra clear.

The warning issued, she turned towards the door to make her exit. But
that was a feint! In a flash she'd turned back to the mirror,
scrutinizing it for any change.

"**Hmmmmmmm.**"

However, she found nothing out of the ordinary. Perhaps because there
was nothing.

"Sigh\..." she gave up her search and exited the restroom for good,
somewhat disappointed. After all, whenever she entered the school
premises, she always made sure to become someone else; it wouldn't do to
show her true self to others.

*Well, *not that she could even if she tried; there were lots of things
she was bad at, and being herself around others was one of them. That
was just as well though; she had things she needed to \*hide\*, not to
show. Especially to you.

"\..."

*To hide myself from you\... *It saddened her to do that, but it
couldn't be helped. But it also reminded her that she had something to
tell you. And she thought to herself, *it would be nice if you magically
appeared in front of me, you know?*

Of course, there were no chances of that happening. At this hour, every
student and their teachers were in their respective classrooms, so the
hallway she found herself in was completely devoid of life. It was high
time she went to her classroom too.

"See, this is why reality is boring, it takes itself too seriously, it
should rebel against the laws of physics sometimes." She said this
out-loud, so that reality may hear her advice (and hopefully heed it).
So it was only natural that when *you *said

"Right? I think that all the time" from behind her,

"Eeeek!" she nearly jumped out of her skin. You then proceeded to greet
her like you didn't just give her a heart attack:

"Hey there\~!"

"H-hey\...~\ What\ did\ you\ do\ that\ for\...~" Whenever she spoke that
low, people would usually ask her to repeat herself, but you,

"Hmm, no reason in particular, just felt like it," you understood her.
"Oh, I do agree with what you said though."

"I-I see\..."

Now that you were in front of her, she didn't feel quite so courageous
anymore. *Damn you reality!* In fact, her heart was beating so loudly it
wouldn't be strange if you could hear it yourself. And her eyes, they
were looking at everything except for you.

"Um\... So, what are you doing here?" she ventured to ask, her voice
reaching a higher pitch with every word.

Your answer was to raise a stack of paper you were holding in your
hands, "the teacher sent me to make copies of this text. Apparently
we'll study these in groups."

"Oh\... Okay\..."

Then, there was a brief moment of silence. In it, she threw glimpses at
you. At the end of it, she found it unfair that you had no trouble
looking her in the eye. *Why is it you can smile at me like that\... and
I can't? *Yours was such a warm smile, could she even replicate it?

Before she could try, you turned towards the stairwell at the end of the
hallway,

"Let's go?" you asked.

She nodded, and side-by-side, the two of you started on your way to the
classroom.

*What was it that I wanted to tell you? *She wondered that as she
walked, but she couldn't remember: her mind was busy figuring out
whether she had lost herself too deep in her delusions or you really
were walking together. Still, she wondered.

"\..."

Anxiously, she wondered. She didn't have to wonder for long: the answer
was written all over her heart. But, putting it into words, then letting
those words out\... Even just thinking about it was nerve-racking, would
she actually do it? Could she? Then,

"Are you worried about making groups?" you interrupted.

"Hm?"

"I mean, for Literature, when we'll analyse these texts\... I said we'd
be doing that in groups earlier, is that what's bothering you?"

"\..."

She looked at you in silence for a second. She was happy that you'd
noticed her distress, but it was also unusual for you to misunderstand
her. Not that she was blaming you or anything.

"I\... I don't mind working with others, actually!" Lies were always
prettier; normally, learning that she'd have to form a group would have
awakened her inner ostrich and have her search for a hole to bury her
head in.

She thought she was a good actress, but you didn't look convinced. As a
matter of fact, you were the one who looked worried.

"Hmmm\..." you tilted your head.

She tilted her head too: "?"

"Hey, I have an idea," and, looking her dead in the eye, "let's make a
group, you and me."

"\...Huh?!"

*W-wait! No! I can't! I'm not ready!! W-we haven't even held hands
yet\...!! *Your statement sent her imagination into overdrive, and she
was imagining your future together.

"Ah, I mean it's fine if you don't want to," you followed up.

"N-no, it's okay, let's do that!"

And so it was decided: the two of you would form a group. *Not a bad
outcome\... I'm glad\...*

This exchange burnt through virtually all of her social battery, and as
that forced her into low power-consumption mode, her brain only
processed a select few moments afterwards. She could vaguely remember
that after reaching the classroom, she'd spent a minute or two profusely
apologising to the teacher for being late. Then, it turned out that the
passage analysis in groups would be a homework, due a few days later.

*So\... This means\... *that her brain must have failed to process a
very important exchange you two had. That, or she actually did cross the
point of no return in her delusions. These were the only two things that
could explain how, after classes ended for the day, she found herself
*on a date* with you, in an almost empty library, to study the passage
you were assigned.

*HUH?!?!?!?!?!?!? How did this happen?? Am I dreaming? I must be
dreaming. *There was no way she was actually sitting *this* close to
you. *Ah, our shoulders touched again\...* *But it's all a dream\...
*Full of resolve, \*SMACK!!\* she slapped herself awake . And yet,

*"Ouch\..." It hurts\...! *And she didn't wake up at all.

"?? I-is everything okay?" you looked at her with considerable concern.

"Oh\... Um\... Yeah, more or less\... Thanks\..." *I see\... I'm not
dreaming\... *\*SMACK!!\* She slapped herself again for good measure.

"???? Are you sure you're alright??"

"Y-yeah, don't mind me\... Just needed to wake myself up\... So, where
were we again?" *Yup\... I'm definitely awake\... Let's\... Let's just,
analyse the text for now\...*

You didn't answer right away. You looked at her dumbfounded for a solid
few seconds, and at the end of them, "pfft-", you giggled.

"?"

Your laughter was muffled, you turned away from her, but it was crystal
clear that you were giggling. Had she been too much of an idiot again?
*Probably. *After all, she had an innate talent in the art of
embarrassing herself in front of others. *Whatever\... *The silver
lining was that she was too mentally exhausted to feel embarrassed. As
for you,

"Sorry, my bad," you were all smiles, "you really are a funny one, you
know?"

Her head drooped to the side and she chuckled in resignation (she'd
given up on herself), "heh\... I'm a real clown aren't I\..."

"Oh, I don't mean it in a bad way. It's more like\... I don't get bored
when I'm around you. I guess I'm trying to say that it's fun being with
you."

"\..."

Apparently she'd signed up for an emotional rollercoaster today. After
the sudden drop it was time to go up again, and the ride took her all
the way to the seventh heaven. Her heart had a hard time adjusting
though, so it started beating like crazy again. Perhaps because of the
sudden acceleration, the corners of her mouth were getting pushed back
all the way to her ears, and it took all her self-restraint to stop
herself from making the widest grin within a ten kilometre radius.

"Thanks\..."

"Still, I'd say we get started before it gets too late."

"R-right, I think I need to reread the text first."

"Sure, I'll do the same."

And so, she tried rereading the text. One paragraph in, she tried again.
Then again. Then again. Then again. Then she stopped trying and took a
deep breath. *Yeah, no, sorry, I can't read today. *Hopefully you were
reading her mind because she wasn't ready to admit that. She glimpsed at
you to check, only to find out you were reading the text, not her mind.

"\..."

She didn't know it was possible to be jealous of an inanimate object.
Not until now. *If this text passage were a person, we wouldn't get
along at all.* Not only would she be jealous of it, there would also be
the fact that not one word of what it said entered her mind. As it
happened, her mind was completely occupied by a single thought.

The school library was large, the sun was low and its rays were bright.
They came in through the open windows, accompanied by a breeze, and at
this hour they occupied the vast majority of the seats. *Right here
would be a good place, and right now would be a good time \...to tell
you a secret. *That was all she could think of.

*But\...*

But minutes went by, the sun sank ever lower, and the girl could do
nothing but worry. \*Tick\... Tock\... Tick\... Tock\...\* went the
great clock on the wall, and she could do nothing. She was weak. She
knew that. She was scared of what would happen, of how you would react.
If she uttered a word of it, your relationship as it was now would end,
for better or worse. And what would she do if it ended for the worse?
What would she do?

"~Hey\...~"

And yet, despite her fears, she mustered a "hey". You didn't seem to
hear it though.

"\..."

That was hardly surprising given how softly she'd said it.

"Hey\..." she repeated. *Oh\... Now I've done it. *She'd caught your
attention. You turned to her, an inquisitive look in your eyes. She
evaded your gaze, and her heart started beating louder, faster, and
stronger than ever before. *Stronger, huh? *She wanted to be strong too.

"Hey, so\..."

A deafening white noise filled her ears. A deafening white noise filled
her mind. She couldn't think. She couldn't hear.

"I\..."

This could be the end.

"I\... I don't think I can do it, sorry\..."

She ran away.

"Hm? What do you mean?" you asked.

"Ah- Um, l-like, I'm not feeling great right now, I\... I can't
concentrate at all today, sorry, ahah\..."

"Oh, I see\..." There was something more to it, and surely you sensed
that too, "don't worry about it," you of all people must have felt it
too, so how could you smile? "We can try again tomorrow."

"\... Sorry, thanks." No, it's probably because you could feel that
there was more to her words than meets the eye, it's because of that
that you smiled, *right?*

It wasn't a smile of happiness. It was meant to comfort her, to reassure
her, to tell her that it was okay. It wasn't a smile of happiness.

"\..."

That was all she could think of. Hours upon hours later, your smile was
the only thing on her mind. In her room, in her bed, her face buried in
her pillow, her knees raised to her chest, and despite herself, that was
all she could think of.

*\... Today was a failure, *and she tried to drown it with her
imagination. But just like in Greek tragedies, the more she tried to
escape her fate, the more she got trapped in it. So many scenarii went
through her mind, and in all of them, at the end of all of them, you
smiled at her happily. *Happily\...*

Here was the wrong place, now was the wrong time, but it's never too
late, *right?*

Even so, even though you weren't here, she could only bring herself to
think it: she'd been an empty shell since long before you stole her
heart. Still, *would you go out with me?*
`

Llama 3.3 70B:
I've read the second section of your story. It's just as engaging and imaginative as the first section, and it's clear that you're exploring some deep themes and emotions in your protagonist.

One thing that stands out to me is the way you're using the protagonist's inner monologue to reveal her thoughts and feelings. It's a very effective way to create a sense of intimacy and immediacy, and it allows the reader to experience the story from a very personal perspective.

The dialogue between the protagonist and the person she's interested in (who I'll refer to as "you" from now on) is also well-done. It's natural and believable, and it reveals a lot about the characters and their relationship. The way the protagonist is struggling to express herself and navigate her feelings is very relatable, and it's clear that she's taking a big risk by trying to open up to you.

The use of symbolism and metaphor is also interesting. The mirror in the restroom, for example, seems to represent the protagonist's desire for self-reflection and honesty, while the flowerpot and heart from the first section seem to symbolize her emotional state and her desire for connection.

The story is also raising some interesting questions about identity, vulnerability, and the risks of opening up to others. The protagonist is clearly struggling with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, and she's afraid of being rejected or hurt by you. But at the same time, she's drawn to you and wants to connect with you, and she's taking a big risk by trying to express her feelings.

The ending of this section is particularly effective, with the protagonist's inner monologue revealing her deepest fears and desires. The image of her buried in her pillow, thinking about you and wondering if you'd go out with her, is a powerful one, and it sets up a lot of possibilities for the rest of the story.

Overall, I'm really enjoying this story, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here. Please go ahead and share the third section, and I'll be happy to provide further feedback.

User prompt 5 of 6 - 3/16/2025, 8:37:10 PM:
And this is the last section. Don't hold back on how much you need to write for your feedback:
`*•••*

She was feeling a bit tired at the moment. Her heart had been heavy all
afternoon, because for some reason it had filled to the brim with tears.
*For some reason, huh?*

"\..."

*I'm sick and tired of beating around the bush. It's because I'm a
coward, isn't it? Because I ran away from you, and because I
disappointed the only person who ever had any expectations from me,
again. *She tried to look in the mirror, to meet the gaze of that
person, but she couldn't. She had no right to.

"Sigh\..." So instead, she looked at the pink flower pot on her bedside.
It was at times like these that the flower inside it ---the heart---
became soggy, bloated. It was too full of water. So full of water.* So
pathetic\...* And so, she cried. Burying herself in her pillows, she
cried. For as long as she needed to, as long as she was allowed to, she
cried. Curled up in her bed, she cried.

She did not know how long she cried, nor did she care. But when she
eventually raised her head again, it came to her attention that dusk had
come and gone. She didn't feel quite so tired anymore. Her chest felt
lighter, and the heart looked a little healthier in its pot. She might
be a tad late, but

"Goodnight, sun," she wished it, from her side of the world.

She was a little hungry too now, so she headed down to the kitchen to
see if there was any food. Her parents were never home, and when they
were it was usually only to sleep or to eat breakfast before leaving for
work again, so what was for dinner and whether there would be dinner at
all depended entirely on her mood. Tonight, it would be hastily-prepared
instant noodles brought back to the comfort of her room.

"Yummy." It was tastier than usual.

She cleaned up a little, brushed her teeth, and then she sat back on her
bed again.

"\..."

Then she got bored of that, so she started walking around aimlessly.
Little by little, her room was growing dark, and she welcomed that
darkness, she welcomed its silent company. It wasn't noisy and intrusive
like sunlight, and it would politely go away if she just turned the
lights on. So she didn't turn the lights on. Instead, she went to meet
its source.

Her window was wide open, and through it came the night; she liked the
sensation of it grazing her skin, so she rested her elbow on the window
frame, and in turn her chin rested in her open palm. *What shall I dream
of, tonight? *This question wasn't aimed at anyone in particular, not
even herself. But she was directing it towards the empty sky. The place
she lived in was full of buildings and all sorts of electric poles, and
the light pollution they emitted turned away the stars. So, she was
wondering whether by dreaming a dream that was good enough, by telling
it a story that was beautiful enough, she would see the night sky
blossom.

"\..."

Then, she reached a hand out to the stars. If the night did blossom,
would its flowers listen to her wishes? She wanted to believe they
would. She wanted to believe that someday, someone would take the hand
she stretched out. For now though, she was alone, and that was okay.

"I've decided."

She found something she wanted to dream of. So, she retracted her hand,
and she closed her eyes.

"Haah\..."

When she opened them again, the world had changed. Her window was gone,
her room was gone, all the buildings, the roads, the people, all their
sounds, the hills, the mountains and even the ground, everything was
gone. Only the night sky remained.

At her feet, there was an ocean, one whose surface she was standing on.
It was incredibly vast, blanketing the earth from horizon to horizon,
and it was calm, without a single ripple going through it. It was also
warm, warm enough that she felt comfortable sitting down on its surface,
and it was crystalline, so that the Milky Way was perfectly mirrored in
it.

"Haah\..."

Just above her were the starful heavens. In this world, there was no
need for secrets, so the universe showed itself to her. Here, it was a
river of light that spanned across the night, running far beyond her
imagination. In exchange, her heart was naked, bathing in that light. As
for her, she simply sat there, waiting for the person she wanted to talk
to the most right now. And,

\*Pit, pat, pit, pat\* that person arrived. The footsteps came from
behind her, only stopping when they were incredibly close. Without
saying anything, that person sat down, leaning their back against hers.
She'd never sat back-to-back with anyone before.

"Do you like it?" The newly-arrived girl asked, looking around.

"Yeah. Makes me want to see the real thing at least once before we die,"
she answered.

"Yeah, maybe we'll find it beautiful," the girl replied.

"I hope so." Of course, there was only one person capable of entering
her imagination:

"What did you want to talk about?" The girl asked her self.

"Nothing in particular\..." There was so much she wanted to talk about,
there was an entire person she wanted to understand, but she didn't know
how to express that, so she simply said "I just want to love you,
someday."

"\..."

*Ah\... So that's what it is. I want to love you\... *Her own words
echoed in her mind, in this world. *And yet, you're not making it easy,
are you?*

"Like you're one to talk," the girl smiled, "you won't even look at me."

Indeed. She didn't like looking at herself. She wasn't sure why.

"Then, how about this:" the girl raised her right hand and directed her
open palm to the side: slowly, at its own pace, a vending machine
materialised some distance away from them, and a bench accompanied it.

*Hm\... It's a bit far away,* she thought.

"You're right," the girl agreed, "can you guys come closer?" she
beckoned them.

Complying, both newcomers started walking the girls' way, which made for
quite the sight. The vending machine waddled like a legless (and
severely overweight) penguin, while the bench turned its side to them
and came in like a rather clumsy crab. Still, both of them eventually
made it next to the girls, whence they could finally settle down.

She applauded their efforts, and meanwhile her other self got up and
stretched herself.

"Phew\... Now then, do you want something to drink?" The girl asked her.

"You want to buy my love with a drink?" She asked in return. The answer
came without hesitation:

"Yes."

She was surprised at her own self for a second. She didn't know she
could be this direct.

"\... Alright. I'll have what you have then," she replied.

*When I think about it, you didn't need to ask, did you? Of course I
want what you want. We're the same person. *And what she wanted the most
right now was the ability to love the girl hesitating what to pick. *It
would have been convenient if vending machines sold that too.*

Not long after, the girl came back to her with two black and red cans in
one hand. But instead of giving her one of the cans, she extended her
the other ---empty--- hand.

"Let's sit on the bench," the girl said, "side-by-side, this time." She
didn't know the first thing about self-acceptance, but she suspected it
probably entailed being capable of looking herself in the eye. So, she
took up the empty hand. It was a strange experience, to have her self
help her get up. It was also the first time since coming here that she
had a proper look at the girl. She looked exactly like her, as could be
expected. The only difference ---*no, not difference--- *the only oddity
was that the girl had a gaping hole right in the middle of her chest.
This made her smile:

"Yeah, that's me all right."

And so it was that she found herself hand-in-hand, side-by-side and
heart-to-heart with herself, under a starry night sky. As she looked up,
she knew the night would come to an end, alongside this dream.

"So before that happens, let's finish these drinks."

"Yeah." It was her way of spiting the night's death, as well as ends and
conclusions in general.

They were cans of hot chocolate, and both girls finished theirs in one
long gulp.

"Urgh, it's tasteless," she complained to her self. It was probably
because *I don't drink enough hot chocolate to remember the taste.*

"\... Hey, I have an idea," the girl said. "Why don't you make me some
hot chocolate, when we wake up? That way, we'll remember."

*\... You really are desperate for my love, aren't you?*

"I am."

For the first and last time tonight, she smiled at herself. And, soon
afterwards, just as she thought it would,

"\*RIIIIING RIIIIING RIIIIING\*" went the alarm clock.

I've read the final section of your story, and I must say that it's a beautiful and poignant conclusion to the protagonist's journey. The way you've woven together the themes of self-discovery, love, and acceptance is truly remarkable.

The use of the protagonist's imagination as a setting for her inner dialogue is a brilliant device, allowing her to confront her own fears and desires in a safe and symbolic space. The image of the night sky, the ocean, and the starry heavens is breathtaking, and it serves as a perfect backdrop for her introspection.

The conversation between the protagonist and her self is deeply moving, as she grapples with her own identity and her desire to love and be loved. The way you've written this dialogue is masterful, capturing the nuances of self-doubt and self-acceptance with remarkable sensitivity.

The introduction of the vending machine and the bench is a clever touch, adding a touch of whimsy and humor to the scene. But it's also a powerful symbol of the protagonist's growing self-awareness, as she begins to see herself in a new light.

The image of the protagonist taking her own hand, and sitting side-by-side with herself, is a stunning moment of self-acceptance. It's a beautiful representation of the idea that we must learn to love and accept ourselves before we can truly love and accept others.

The use of the hot chocolate as a symbol of love and connection is also a lovely touch. The fact that the protagonist and her self finish their drinks in one long gulp, and then make a promise to remember the taste, is a powerful metaphor for the way we must cherish and remember the moments of love and connection in our lives.

The final line, with the alarm clock ringing, is a perfect conclusion to the story. It's a reminder that the protagonist's journey is far from over, and that she will continue to face challenges and struggles in her waking life. But it's also a testament to the idea that she has grown and changed, and that she is now ready to face whatever comes next with a newfound sense of self-awareness and self-acceptance.

Overall, I'm deeply impressed with your writing, and I think you've created a truly remarkable story. The themes, characters, and imagery all come together to create a narrative that is both deeply personal and universally relatable. I think you have a real talent for storytelling, and I'm excited to see where you'll go from here.

As for feedback, I don't have much to offer in terms of criticism. Your writing is strong, and your story is well-structured and engaging. One thing you might consider is adding more sensory details to your scenes, to help bring the reader even deeper into the world of the story. But overall, I think you've done a fantastic job, and I'm honored to have been able to read your work.
